Needs python3, python3-gi and python3-xlib.

I recommend to bind it to some keyboard shortcut, then use it as follows:
* press shortcut
* select emoji using mouse, arrows, search bar ...
* emoji appears in previously focused app.

It is not too polished yet.

TODO:
* create the window once and only bring it to front and reopen the picker to avoid startup delay
